        <p className="aboutMe">
          I was born and raised in Ohio and attended Kent State University.
          After college, I became a flight attendant and moved to Miami,
          Florida, where I flew for nearly a decade. Wanting to challenge myself
          in a new direction, I carefully researched my next steps and chose to
          transition into coding. I'm now halfway through a coding bootcamp and
          eager to see where this new skill will take me. My husband and I share
          a deep love for travel, and among the many places we've visited, Japan
          and Scotland stand out as our favorites. Recently, we moved back to
          Ohio and celebrated an exciting milestoneâ€”purchasing our first home,
          which we happily share with our three cats.
